# Queue Pipeline Smoke Test - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive smoke test infrastructure has been implemented to validate the queue pipeline from end to end. The system tests job submission, processing, validation, and reporting.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Fixtures (tests/fixtures/smoke_jobs/)
Five representative job scenarios covering key test dimensions:

- **remote_job.json** - Standard remote job with tech stack alignment
- **hybrid_portland.json** - Portland office with hybrid arrangement (tests Portland bonus)
- **onsite_california.json** - On-site only position (tests filtering)
- **global_company.json** - Fortune 500 company (tests large company handling)
- **high_seniority.json** - Principal level position (tests seniority matching)

Each fixture includes complete job data and test case notes explaining its purpose.

### 2. Smoke Test Runner (scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py)
Full-featured test runner with:

**Core Functionality:**
- Fixture loading from JSON files
- Job submission via ScraperIntake
- Firestore polling until terminal state
- Structured report generation (markdown + JSON)

**Validation Checks:**
- Duplicate URL detection (using normalize_url)
- Required scoring fields validation (matchScore, matchedSkills, etc.)
- Document reference validation (placeholder for future)

**CLI Options:**
```bash
--env {staging,local,production}  # Environment selection
--fixtures FIXTURES                # Custom fixtures directory
--output OUTPUT                    # Custom output directory
--dry-run                          # Validate without submitting
--timeout TIMEOUT                  # Poll timeout in seconds
--verbose                          # Detailed logging
```

**Output:**
- Markdown report with summary, validation results, and job details
- JSON report with complete metadata and results
- Saved to `test_results/queue_smoke/<timestamp>/`

### 3. Documentation (docs/testing/queue-smoke.md)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Test scenario descriptions
- Usage instructions and examples
- Environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- CI/CD integration instructions
- Best practices

### 4. Makefile Integration
Added `make smoke-queue` target:
```bash
make smoke-queue  # Runs smoke test on staging
```

Help text updated to include smoke test in testing section.

### 5. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/smoke-queue.yml)
Manual workflow trigger with:
- Environment selection (staging/production)
- Timeout configuration
- AI stub support (USE_AI_STUBS=true)
- Artifact upload for test results
- Validation status check
- Summary comment in workflow output

### 6. Unit Tests (tests/smoke/test_smoke_runner.py)
12 comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Runner initialization
- Fixture loading (including error cases)
- Job submission (dry-run mode)
- Result validation (duplicates, fields)
- Report generation
- Helper function consistency

All tests passing with proper mocking.

## Key Features

### Dry-Run Mode
Test the smoke test infrastructure without Firestore dependencies:
```bash
python scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py --env staging --dry-run
```

### Environment Support
- **staging**: Safe testing on portfolio-staging database
- **local**: Development with local worker
- **production**: Post-deployment validation (use carefully)

### Validation
- **Duplicate URLs**: Detects multiple jobs with same normalized URL
- **Scoring Fields**: Validates presence of required AI-generated fields
- **Document References**: Placeholder for document generation validation

### Reporting
Structured output with:
- Summary statistics (total jobs, status breakdown, avg time)
- Validation results with pass/fail for each check
- Individual job details with fixture metadata
- Both markdown (human-readable) and JSON (machine-readable)

## Usage Examples

### Quick Test (Dry Run)
```bash
python scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py --env staging --dry-run
```

### Full Staging Test
```bash
python scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py --env staging
```

### Custom Fixtures
```bash
python scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py \
  --fixtures /path/to/custom/fixtures \
  --timeout 900 \
  --verbose
```

### Via Makefile
```bash
make smoke-queue
```

### Via GitHub Actions
1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Select "Queue Smoke Test" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose environment
5. Review results

## Test Commands Verified

✅ `pytest tests/smoke` - All 12 unit tests pass
✅ `python scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py --env staging --dry-run` - Dry run works
✅ `make smoke-queue` - Makefile target executes (requires credentials)
✅ Linting passes (flake8)
✅ Formatting passes (black)

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `tests/fixtures/smoke_jobs/` (5 JSON fixtures + README)
- `scripts/smoke/queue_pipeline_smoke.py` (smoke test runner)
- `tests/smoke/test_smoke_runner.py` (unit tests)
- `docs/testing/queue-smoke.md` (documentation)
- `.github/workflows/smoke-queue.yml` (CI workflow)
- `docs/testing/SMOKE_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

**Modified:**
- `.gitignore` (added test_results/)
- `Makefile` (added smoke-queue target)

## Integration Points

### Existing Components Used
- `ScraperIntake` - Job submission interface
- `QueueManager` - Queue item management
- `FirestoreJobStorage` - Job matches validation
- `normalize_url` - Duplicate detection
- `QueueStatus` - Terminal state checking

### No Breaking Changes
All changes are additive. Existing functionality remains unchanged.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements noted in documentation:
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (compare against baselines)
- [ ] Cost tracking (estimate AI API costs)
- [ ] Document generation validation
- [ ] Parallel job submission for speed
- [ ] Integration with Slack/email notifications
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Automated cleanup of test data
- [ ] Support for custom validation rules
