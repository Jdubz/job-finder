# WORKER-CICD-1 — Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## Issue Metadata

```yaml
Title: WORKER-CICD-1 — Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
Labels: [priority-p1, repository-worker, type-ci, status-todo, ci-cd]
Assignee: TBD
Priority: P1-High
Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours
Repository: job-finder-worker
GitHub Issue: #65
```

## Summary

**P1 HIGH IMPACT**: Set up comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for the job-finder-worker Python project to ensure code quality, automated testing, and reliable deployments. Currently the worker has no CI/CD automation, creating deployment risks and inconsistent code quality.

## Background & Context

### Project Overview

**Application Name**: Job Finder Worker  
**Technology Stack**: Python 3.9+, Docker, PostgreSQL/Firebase, pytest  
**Architecture**: Containerized Python application with automated CI/CD pipelines

### This Repository's Role

The job-finder-worker repository contains the Python application that processes job queues, performs AI-powered job matching, scrapes job postings, and integrates with job-finder-FE frontend and job-finder-BE backend services.

### Current State

The deployment process currently:

- ❌ **No GitHub Actions workflows** for automated testing
- ❌ **No automated Docker builds** or deployments
- ❌ **No code quality checks** in CI environment
- ❌ **Manual testing** and deployment processes
- ❌ **No deployment verification** or rollback capabilities

### Desired State

After completion:

- Automated testing on every PR and push
- Automated Docker image builds and registry publishing
- Code quality checks (linting, security, type checking)
- Automated deployment to staging and production
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments

## Technical Specifications

### Affected Files

```yaml
CREATE:
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml - Python testing and quality checks
  - .github/workflows/docker-build.yml - Docker image building and publishing
  - .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml - Staging environment deployment
  - .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml - Production deployment
  - .github/workflows/security.yml - Security scanning and dependency checks
  - .github/workflows/README.md - Workflow documentation

MODIFY:
  - Dockerfile - Ensure compatibility with GitHub Actions
  - requirements.txt - Add any CI-specific dependencies
  - pyproject.toml - Update for CI compatibility
```

### Technology Requirements

**Languages**: Python, YAML, Shell Script  
**Frameworks**: GitHub Actions, Docker, pytest  
**Tools**: Python 3.9+, Docker, PostgreSQL client  
**Dependencies**: Existing Python dependencies

### Code Standards

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing workflow naming patterns  
**File Organization**: Standard GitHub Actions structure  
**Import Style**: Use existing Python import patterns

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Create CI Testing Workflow**
   - Set up Python 3.9+ testing environment
   - Install dependencies from requirements files
   - Run linting (flake8, black, isort)
   - Run type checking (mypy)
   - Execute full test suite with coverage
   - Generate coverage reports

2. **Create Docker Build Workflow**
   - Build Docker image using existing Dockerfile
   - Run security scanning on container
   - Test container functionality
   - Push to GitHub Container Registry
   - Tag with commit SHA and branch

3. **Create Deployment Workflows**
   - Deploy to staging on main branch pushes
   - Require manual approval for production
   - Run integration tests post-deployment
   - Create deployment rollback procedures

4. **Add Security Scanning**
   - Run dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Check for secrets in code
   - Validate Docker image security
   - Monitor for insecure configurations

5. **Create Documentation**
   - Document workflow structure and purpose
   - Add troubleshooting guides
   - Update deployment procedures

### Architecture Decisions

**Why this approach:**

- Standard GitHub Actions patterns for Python projects
- Separate workflows for different concerns (test, build, deploy)
- Integration with existing Docker setup

**Alternatives considered:**

- Jenkins/GitLab CI: More complex setup, not aligned with existing tools
- Manual deployment: Unacceptable for production reliability

### Dependencies & Integration

**Internal Dependencies:**

- Depends on: Existing Python code and tests
- Consumed by: Deployment process and development workflow

**External Dependencies:**

- APIs: GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub
- Services: PostgreSQL/Firebase for integration tests

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Required

**Integration Tests:**

- CI workflow runs successfully end-to-end
- Docker build process works correctly
- Deployment verification functions properly

**Manual Testing Checklist**

- [ ] CI workflow passes on main branch
- [ ] Docker images build and run correctly
- [ ] Staging deployment works automatically
- [ ] Production deployment requires approval
- [ ] Security scanning runs without false positives

### Test Data

**Sample workflow scenarios:**

- Push to main branch triggers successful CI and deployment
- PR creation triggers appropriate quality checks
- Failed tests block deployment
- Manual production deployment works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows pass on main branch
- [ ] PRs require passing CI checks before merge
- [ ] Docker images are built and published automatically
- [ ] Staging deployment works automatically on main
- [ ] Production deployment requires manual approval
- [ ] Security scanning runs on all changes
- [ ] Code quality checks (linting, security, type checking) are automated
- [ ] Test coverage reporting is integrated
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedures are available
- [ ] CI/CD documentation is comprehensive

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required tools and versions
Python: 3.9+
Docker: latest
GitHub Actions: configured
PostgreSQL: for integration tests
```

### Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone worker repository
git clone https://github.com/Jdubz/job-finder-worker.git
cd job-finder-worker

# Environment variables needed
cp .env.example .env
# Configure test database settings
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Test CI equivalent locally
python -m pytest --cov=src/job_finder

# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t job-finder-worker:test .

# Test container functionality
docker run --rm job-finder-worker:test python -c "import job_finder; print('Import successful')"
```

## Code Examples & Patterns

### Example Implementation

**CI workflow structure:**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security

- [ ] No secrets exposed in workflow logs
- [ ] Proper secret handling in CI environment
- [ ] Container security scanning enabled

### Performance

- [ ] CI execution time: <10 minutes total
- [ ] Parallel job execution where possible
- [ ] Efficient Docker layer caching

### Error Handling

```yaml
# Example error handling in workflow
- name: Deploy to Staging
  if: success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    if ! docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d; then
      echo "Deployment failed - triggering rollback"
      # Rollback logic
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Add comments to workflows explaining each step
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements

### README Updates

Update repository README.md with:

- [ ] CI/CD setup and workflow descriptions
- [ ] How to run tests locally vs CI
- [ ] Deployment process documentation
