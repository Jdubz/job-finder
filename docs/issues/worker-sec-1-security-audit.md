# WORKER-SEC-1 â€” Comprehensive Security Audit

- **Status**: To Do
- **Owner**: Worker A
- **Priority**: P1 (High Impact)
- **Labels**: priority-p1, repository-worker, type-security, critical
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: None

## What This Issue Covers

Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the job-finder-worker to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, ensure data protection, and establish security best practices.

## Context

The job-finder-worker handles sensitive operations:
- Processes user profile data (experience, contact info)
- Scrapes external websites (potential DoS risks)
- Makes API calls to AI providers (cost and data exposure)
- Stores job data in Firestore (privacy concerns)
- Runs automated processes (potential for abuse)

Security gaps could lead to:
- Data breaches of user information
- Financial losses from AI API abuse
- Account suspensions from aggressive scraping
- Legal issues from improper data handling

## Tasks

### 1. Authentication and Authorization Audit
- [ ] Review all external API integrations (AI providers, web scraping)
- [ ] Verify API key storage and rotation procedures
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Audit Firestore access controls and permissions
- [ ] Review environment variable handling

### 2. Data Protection Assessment
- [ ] Identify all sensitive data flows (user profiles, job data, API responses)
- [ ] Check data encryption in transit and at rest
- [ ] Verify PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling
- [ ] Audit data retention policies
- [ ] Check for proper data sanitization

### 3. Web Scraping Security Review
- [ ] Audit scraping rate limiting and delays
- [ ] Check for bot detection evasion techniques
- [ ] Review robots.txt compliance
- [ ] Verify proper User-Agent strings
- [ ] Check for IP rotation or proxy usage

### 4. API Security Analysis
- [ ] Review AI provider API usage patterns
- [ ] Check for proper error handling (no credential leaks)
- [ ] Verify request/response logging doesn't expose secrets
- [ ] Audit API quota management and cost controls

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Review Docker container security
- [ ] Check dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify proper secret management
- [ ] Audit logging and monitoring for security events

### 6. Compliance and Legal Review
- [ ] Check GDPR compliance for EU user data
- [ ] Review Terms of Service compliance for scraped sites
- [ ] Verify data collection transparency
- [ ] Check for proper privacy policy implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive security audit report created
- [ ] All high-risk vulnerabilities documented and prioritized
- [ ] Security hardening recommendations implemented
- [ ] Updated security documentation for maintainers
- [ ] Security testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Compliance checklist created and verified

## Security Audit Checklist

### Authentication & Access Control
- [ ] API keys properly stored and rotated
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Proper environment variable validation
- [ ] Firestore security rules reviewed and tested

### Data Protection
- [ ] User PII properly identified and protected
- [ ] Data encryption implemented where needed
- [ ] Secure data transmission verified
- [ ] Data retention policies documented

### Web Scraping Security
- [ ] Rate limiting properly implemented
- [ ] Respect for robots.txt verified
- [ ] Appropriate User-Agent strings used
- [ ] Anti-bot detection measures in place

### API Security
- [ ] No API credentials in logs or error messages
- [ ] Proper error handling prevents information leaks
- [ ] API quotas and costs properly managed
- [ ] Request/response sizes limited appropriately

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Container images from trusted sources
- [ ] Secrets properly managed in production
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting configured

## Test Commands

```bash
# Security scanning
bandit -r src/ -f json -o security-report.json
safety check --json --output security-vulnerabilities.json

# Dependency audit
pip-audit --format=json > dependency-audit.json

# Container security
docker scan job-finder-worker:latest

# Secrets detection
detect-secrets scan --all-files
```

## Useful Files

- `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `config/config.yaml` - Configuration settings
- `src/job_finder/` - Source code for security review

## Dependencies

- None (can start immediately)

## Notes

- Focus on identifying and documenting risks first, then prioritize fixes
- Document any intentional security trade-offs with clear rationale
- Ensure all security fixes are tested thoroughly
- Consider creating automated security tests for CI/CD
- Document security procedures for future maintainers
