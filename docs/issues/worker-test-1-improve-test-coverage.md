# WORKER-TEST-1 — Improve Test Coverage and Quality

- **Status**: To Do
- **Owner**: Worker A
- **Priority**: P1 (High Impact)
- **Labels**: priority-p1, repository-worker, type-testing, quality
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Dependencies**: None

## What This Issue Covers

Improve test coverage from current ~50% to >90% and enhance test quality across the job-finder-worker codebase. Current testing gaps create risk of undetected bugs in production deployments.

## Context

The job-finder-worker is a complex system with multiple components:
- AI-powered job matching (matcher.py, providers.py)
- Queue management (processor.py, manager.py)
- Data scraping (scrapers/, company info fetcher)
- Storage integration (Firestore, local storage)
- Profile management (loader.py, schema.py)

Current test coverage is insufficient for a production system, with gaps in:
- AI provider integrations
- Queue processing edge cases
- Error handling scenarios
- Integration between components

## Tasks

### 1. Coverage Analysis and Gap Identification
- [ ] Generate detailed coverage report: `pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=html`
- [ ] Identify modules with <70% coverage
- [ ] Document critical paths missing test coverage
- [ ] Create coverage improvement roadmap

### 2. Core Component Testing
- [ ] **AI Provider Tests** (`tests/ai/`):
  - Test Claude provider integration
  - Test OpenAI provider integration
  - Test provider fallback mechanisms
  - Test rate limiting and error handling
  - Test prompt template rendering

- [ ] **Queue Processor Tests** (`tests/queue/`):
  - Test job processing pipeline end-to-end
  - Test error recovery and retry logic
  - Test queue state management
  - Test concurrent processing scenarios
  - Test queue cleanup operations

- [ ] **Storage Integration Tests** (`tests/storage/`):
  - Test Firestore client operations
  - Test local storage fallbacks
  - Test data validation and sanitization
  - Test connection error handling

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Pipeline Tests** (`tests/e2e/`):
  - Test complete job submission → processing → results flow
  - Test AI matching with real job data
  - Test profile loading from Firestore
  - Test storage of results

- [ ] **Cross-Component Integration**:
  - Test scraper → queue → processor → storage flow
  - Test profile loading → AI matching → results storage
  - Test error propagation across components

### 4. Edge Case and Error Testing
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**:
  - Network failures during scraping
  - AI provider API failures
  - Database connection issues
  - Invalid profile data
  - Malformed job data

- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Empty queues
  - Large datasets
  - Concurrent operations
  - Memory constraints
  - Timeout scenarios

### 5. Test Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] **Test Fixtures**:
  - Create realistic job posting fixtures
  - Create comprehensive profile test data
  - Create mock AI responses
  - Create Firestore test data

- [ ] **Test Utilities**:
  - Database cleanup utilities
  - Mock server setup for external APIs
  - Test data generators
  - Performance benchmarking tools

### 6. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Set minimum coverage thresholds (90% overall, 95% for critical paths)
- [ ] Fail builds on coverage decreases
- [ ] Generate coverage badges for README
- [ ] Add coverage trends to CI reports

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overall test coverage >90%
- [ ] Critical path coverage >95%
- [ ] All new features include comprehensive tests
- [ ] CI pipeline enforces coverage requirements
- [ ] Test execution time <5 minutes for full suite
- [ ] Tests run successfully in Docker environment
- [ ] Integration tests pass against staging environment

## Test Commands

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/ai/ -v                    # AI provider tests
pytest tests/queue/ -v                 # Queue tests
pytest tests/e2e/ -v                   # Integration tests
pytest tests/storage/ -v               # Storage tests

# Run with coverage thresholds
pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-fail-under=90

# Performance testing
pytest --durations=10 --durations-min=1.0
```

## Useful Files

- `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Coverage settings
- `requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data
- `tests/e2e/` - Integration test scenarios

## Dependencies

- None (can start immediately)

## Notes

- Focus on testing the most critical user-facing functionality first
- Use realistic test data that matches production scenarios
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable for CI/CD integration
- Document any intentional test exclusions with clear rationale
- Consider using pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
