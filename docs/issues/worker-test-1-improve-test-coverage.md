Title: WORKER-TEST-1 — Improve Test Coverage and Quality
Labels:
  [priority-p1, repository-worker, type-testing, status-todo, test-coverage]
Assignee: TBD
Priority: P1-High
Estimated Effort: 4-5 days
Repository: job-finder-worker
GitHub Issue: #66
```

## Summary

**P1 HIGH IMPACT**: Improve test coverage from current ~50% to >90% and enhance test quality across the job-finder-worker codebase. Critical for ensuring code reliability and preventing regressions in production.

## Background & Context

### Project Overview

**Application Name**: Job Finder Worker  
**Technology Stack**: Python 3.9+, pytest, coverage.py  
**Architecture**: Python application with comprehensive test coverage

### This Repository's Role

The job-finder-worker repository contains the Python application that processes job queues, performs AI-powered job matching, scrapes job postings, and integrates with job-finder-FE frontend and job-finder-BE backend services.

### Current State

The testing infrastructure currently:

- ✅ **Basic test framework**: pytest is configured and working
- ❌ **Low test coverage**: ~50% coverage across codebase
- ❌ **Missing critical tests**: Key functions lack comprehensive testing
- ❌ **No integration tests**: API endpoints and workflows untested
- ❌ **Inconsistent test quality**: Some tests lack proper assertions
- ❌ **No coverage reporting**: CI/CD doesn't track coverage metrics

### Desired State

After completion:

- Test coverage >90% across all modules
- Comprehensive unit tests for all major functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints and workflows
- High-quality test assertions with edge case coverage
- Automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
- Clear testing guidelines and documentation

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Analyze Current Coverage**
   - Run coverage analysis to identify gaps
   - Identify critical code paths needing tests
   - Document current test coverage by module
   - Prioritize testing areas by risk and complexity

2. **Enhance Unit Tests**
   - Add comprehensive tests for AI matcher functions
   - Test queue processor with various scenarios
   - Add scraper functionality tests
   - Test utility functions and helpers
   - Add edge case and error condition tests

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test API endpoints with real data
   - Test workflow integration scenarios
   - Test database interactions
   - Test external service integrations
   - Add end-to-end workflow tests

4. **Improve Test Quality**
   - Enhance test assertions with better error messages
   - Add parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
   - Implement proper test fixtures and setup
   - Add test data factories for consistent test data
   - Improve test documentation and comments

5. **Setup Coverage Reporting**
   - Configure coverage.py for comprehensive reporting
   - Add coverage reporting to CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up coverage thresholds and enforcement
   - Create coverage reports and documentation

6. **Create Testing Documentation**
   - Document testing guidelines and best practices
   - Create test writing examples and patterns
   - Document how to run tests locally and in CI
   - Add troubleshooting guides for test failures

### Architecture Decisions

**Why this approach:**

- Comprehensive coverage ensures reliability
- Integration tests catch real-world issues
- Quality improvements prevent flaky tests
- Documentation enables team collaboration

**Alternatives considered:**

- Focus only on unit tests: Misses integration issues
- Manual testing only: Not scalable or reliable
- Lower coverage threshold: Insufficient for production reliability

### Dependencies & Integration

**Internal Dependencies:**

- Depends on: Existing codebase and test framework
- Consumed by: CI/CD pipeline and development workflow

**External Dependencies:**

- APIs: Test database, external service mocks
- Services: Coverage reporting tools, CI/CD systems

## Testing Requirements

    # Test error conditions and exceptions
    # Test performance with large datasets
```

## Code Examples & Patterns

### Example Implementation

**Comprehensive test structure:**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from src.job_finder.ai.matcher import AIMatcher

class TestAIMatcherComprehensive:
    """Comprehensive tests for AI matcher functionality"""

    @pytest.fixture
    def matcher(self):
        return AIMatcher()

    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_job_profile(self):
        return {
            "title": "Software Engineer",
            "company": "Tech Corp",
            "location": "San Francisco, CA",
            "requirements": ["Python", "React", "AWS"]
        }

    def test_normal_matching_scenario(self, matcher, sample_job_profile):
        """Test normal job matching scenario"""
        result = matcher.match_job(sample_job_profile)
        assert result.score > 0.7
        assert result.matched_skills == ["Python", "React"]

    def test_edge_case_empty_profile(self, matcher):
        """Test edge case with empty job profile"""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            matcher.match_job({})

    def test_performance_large_dataset(self, matcher):
        """Test performance with large dataset"""
        large_profile = {"requirements": ["skill" + str(i) for i in range(1000)]}
        start_time = time.time()
        result = matcher.match_job(large_profile)
        assert time.time() - start_time < 1.0  # Should complete within 1 second
```

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security

- [ ] Test data doesn't contain sensitive information
- [ ] Tests don't expose production credentials
- [ ] Mock external services properly
- [ ] Validate input sanitization in tests

### Performance

- [ ] Tests complete within reasonable time (<5 minutes)
- [ ] Large dataset tests are optimized
- [ ] Memory usage is controlled in tests
- [ ] Parallel test execution where possible

### Error Handling

```python
# Example error handling in tests
def test_error_conditions():
    """Test various error conditions and exceptions"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid input"):
        matcher.match_job(None)

    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):
        matcher.match_job({"external_api": "unavailable"})
```
