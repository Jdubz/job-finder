# E2E Test Suite: Complete Improvement Strategy

**Created:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Target:** Improve staging environment E2E test reliability and accuracy

---

## Quick Summary of Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: Job Deduplication Failures

**Problem:** Repeated scans create duplicate job entries. Same job URL appears multiple times in job-matches collection.

**Root Cause:** 
- `job_exists()` performs individual Firestore query per job (N+1 problem)
- No URL normalization (trailing slashes, params, case sensitivity)
- No caching of recent lookups

**Solutions:**
1. Batch URL checking with `batch_check_exists()` â†’ Reduce 50 queries to ~5
2. URL normalization with `normalize_url()` â†’ Handle formatting variations
3. Checksum-based lookups using `urlHash` field â†’ Faster queries
4. Deduplication cache â†’ Avoid repeated Firestore reads

**Impact:** Duplicates eliminated, 90% faster dedup checks

---

### Issue #2: Source Rotation Failures

**Problem:** Sources not rotated fairly. Some companies always scraped, others never. E2E tests can't verify rotation is working.

**Root Cause:**
- Incomplete timestamp tracking (`scraped_at` sometimes null)
- Rotation algorithm ignores source health and priority
- No company fairness mechanism
- Test verification uses unreliable timestamp comparison

**Solutions:**
1. Comprehensive health tracking â†’ Track `lastScrapedAt`, success/failure counts
2. Improved rotation with scoring â†’ Health Ã— Tier Ã— Age Ã— Company Fairness
3. Company fairness tracker â†’ Ensure all companies get equal rotation
4. Enhanced test verification â†’ Multi-point validation (timestamp + success count + job count)

**Impact:** Fair rotation across all sources, reliable test verification

---

### Issue #3: E2E Tests Hanging/Timing Out

**Problem:** Tests hang or timeout without clear reason. No visibility into what's happening. Hard to debug.

**Root Cause:**
- Fixed 300s timeout for all operations (doesn't account for staging slowness)
- No exponential backoff for transient issues
- No pre-flight health checks (Portainer/Firestore might not be ready)
- Timeout errors lack diagnostic information

**Solutions:**
1. Adaptive timeout with backoff â†’ Adjust based on queue type, exponential backoff
2. Pre-flight health checks â†’ Verify Firestore, GCP, Portainer before tests
3. Status history tracking â†’ Reconstruct timeline for debugging
4. Enhanced error reporting â†’ Include logs, diagnostics, Google Cloud links

**Impact:** Fewer false timeouts, faster debugging when issues occur

- `src/job_finder/storage/job_sources_manager.py` - Add health tracking

New files:
- `src/job_finder/storage/source_health_tracker.py`
- `src/job_finder/storage/company_scrape_tracker.py`

Tests:
- `tests/e2e/scenarios/scenario_04_scrape_rotation.py` - Enhanced verification
- Run Scenario 4 multiple times to verify fairness

### Phase 3: Timeout/Reliability (2-3 hours)
**Branch:** `feature/e2e-reliability-fixes`

Files to modify:
- `tests/e2e/helpers/queue_monitor.py` - Adaptive timeout, backoff

New files:
- `tests/e2e/helpers/health_check.py` - Pre-flight checks
- `tests/e2e/helpers/status_tracker.py` - Detailed diagnostics

Tests:
- `tests/e2e/run_all_scenarios.py` - Add health checks
- Run full suite to check timeout improvements

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (2 hours)
**Branch:** `staging` (integrate all improvements)

Activities:
- Run full E2E test suite multiple times
- Monitor Google Cloud logs
- Document results
- Update README and troubleshooting guide

## Key Files to Monitor

### Core Logic
- `src/job_finder/scrape_runner.py` - Main scraping orchestration
- `src/job_finder/storage/firestore_storage.py` - Job storage
- `src/job_finder/storage/job_sources_manager.py` - Source management

### E2E Tests
- `tests/e2e/run_all_scenarios.py` - Main test runner
- `tests/e2e/scenarios/scenario_*.py` - Individual scenarios
- `tests/e2e/helpers/queue_monitor.py` - Queue polling

### Configuration
- `config/config.yaml` - Main config
- `docs/E2E_TEST_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan
- `docs/E2E_TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - How to run tests

---

## Testing Strategy

### Before Implementation
```bash
# Baseline E2E test run
python tests/e2e/run_all_scenarios.py --verbose 2>&1 | tee baseline_$(date +%s).log
```

### After Each Phase
```bash
# Run E2E tests to verify fix
python tests/e2e/run_all_scenarios.py --verbose

# Check for regressions
python tests/test_firestore_storage.py
python tests/test_scraper_runner.py
```

### Monitoring During Tests
```bash
# In another terminal, monitor Google Cloud logs
gcloud logging read "labels.test_run_id='e2e_test_*'" --limit 50 --format=json

# Or check Portainer dashboard:
# http://nas-ip:9000
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Verification |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Duplicate jobs | High | 0 | E2E Scenario 1 passes |
| Rotation fairness | Biased | ~Equal | Scenario 4 shows all sources scraped |
| Test timeout rate | 10-20% | <2% | Run suite 10x, count failures |
| Average dedup time | 5-10s/50 jobs | <1s/50 jobs | Profile batch_check_exists() |
| Diagnostic quality | Poor | Excellent | Timeout errors include Google Cloud link |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Break existing dedup | Low | High | Keep old function, test both paths |
| Slow down rotation | Medium | Medium | Profile performance, add timeouts |
| Test flakiness increases | Low | High | Add comprehensive health checks |
| Portainer worker crashes | Low | Medium | Implement pre-flight checks |

## Documentation Updates Needed

After implementation:
1. Update `README.md` with E2E test running instructions
2. Update `DEPLOYMENT.md` with staging environment notes
3. Create troubleshooting guide for E2E test issues
4. Add performance tuning recommendations
5. Document monitoring/alerting setup

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Review this plan** and the detailed improvement plan document
2. **Create feature branches** off `staging`
3. **Start with Phase 1** (deduplication) - lowest risk, highest impact
4. **Run baseline E2E tests** before starting (document current behavior)
5. **Implement incrementally**, testing after each change
6. **Monitor Google Cloud logs** during all test runs
7. **Create PR for each phase** with test results

## Questions & Clarifications

### Q: Will these changes affect production?
**A:** No. All changes are internal optimization. Job dedup, rotation, and timeouts work the same externally.

### Q: How long will tests take with improvements?
**A:** Similar to now (5-15 min total) but with fewer timeouts and better diagnostics.

### Q: Should we run tests continuously?
**A:** Recommend after each deployment to staging, plus nightly smoke tests.

### Q: What if tests still fail after improvements?
**A:** Diagnostics will be much better. Error messages will include Google Cloud links and status timelines for debugging.
