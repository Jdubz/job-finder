# E2E Documentation Consolidation Plan

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Problem

**17 E2E documentation files scattered in root directory**, causing:
- Confusion about which doc to read
- Duplicate/conflicting information
- Hard to maintain
- Poor discoverability

---

## Solution

### New Structure

```
docs/e2e/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Main entry point (comprehensive overview)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GETTING_STARTED.md     # Setup and first test
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USER_GUIDE.md          # Day-to-day usage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE.md        # System design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TROUBLESHOOTING.md     # Common issues
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SAFETY.md              # Production protection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md           # Version history
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md        # Development guidelines
```

- [ ] Create USER_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Create TROUBLESHOOTING.md

- Confusing, hard to navigate

### After
- 0 files in root (E2E-specific)
- 8 files in docs/e2e/
- Total: **8 well-organized files**
- Clear structure, easy to find

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**Old:**
```bash
# Where do I start?
ls E2E*.md  # 17 files... which one?
```

**New:**

**Status:** Phase 1 complete, proceeding with Phase 2
