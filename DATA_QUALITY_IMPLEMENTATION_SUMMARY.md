# Implementation Summary: Data Quality Monitoring for E2E Tests

## Overview

I've implemented a **comprehensive data quality monitoring system** for your E2E tests. Your tests now validate that your automation tool is not just running without errors, but actually improving the quality of collected company data, job sources, and job listings.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. DataQualityMonitor Class (580 lines)

**File:** `tests/e2e/helpers/data_quality_monitor.py`

A complete monitoring system that:

- **Tracks three data types:**
  - Companies (name, website, about, tier, techStack, etc.)
  - Job sources (name, sourceType, config, enabled, etc.)
  - Job matches (title, company, link, description, etc.)

- **Validates against schemas:**
  - Required fields (must be present)
  - Recommended fields (should be present)
  - Optional fields (nice to have)

- **Scores each entity (0-100):**
  - Completeness: What % of fields are populated?
  - Accuracy: What % of fields pass validation?
  - Overall Quality: Combined score (60% completeness, 40% accuracy)

- **Tracks improvements:**
  - New entities created
  - Existing entities improved
  - Validation errors per entity
  - Data issues logged

### 2. Updated Test Runner

**File:** `tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py`

Enhanced the test runner to:

- Initialize `DataQualityMonitor` automatically
- Inject monitor into test scenarios
- Display data quality report after tests
- Show created/improved entity counts
- Display quality metrics and improvement tracking
- Added `--no-quality` flag for tests without monitoring

### 3. Updated Exports

**File:** `tests/e2e/helpers/__init__.py`

Added exports:
- `DataQualityMonitor`
- `EntityMetrics`
- `TestDataQualityReport`
- `format_quality_report()`

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation (2500+ lines)

**Files:**
- `docs/DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING.md` - Complete feature guide (1000+ lines)
- `docs/DATA_QUALITY_QUICKREF.md` - Quick reference with examples (500+ lines)
- `docs/E2E_COMPLETE_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration guide (600+ lines)

## Key Features

### Quality Scoring System

Each entity gets three scores:

```
Completeness = (Required % × 0.7) + (Recommended % × 0.3)
Accuracy = 100% - (Errors / Total Fields × 100%)
Overall = (Completeness × 0.6) + (Accuracy × 0.4)
```

### Validation Schemas

**Company Schema:**
- Required: name, website
- Recommended: about, tier, techStack, hasPortlandOffice, priorityScore
- Optional: company_size_category, headquarters_location

**Job Source Schema:**
- Required: name, sourceType, config, enabled
- Recommended: companyId, company_name, tags
- Optional: lastScrapedAt, totalJobsFound, totalJobsMatched

**Job Match Schema:**
- Required: title, company, link (URL)
- Recommended: description, location, matchScore, company_info
- Optional: sourceId, scrapedAt, matchedAt, urlHash

### Entity Metrics

Each entity tracked with:
- Completeness level (COMPLETE, PARTIAL, MINIMAL)
- Validation errors list
- Data issues list
- Healthy status (all validations pass + score ≥ 80)

### Report Generation

Beautiful formatted reports showing:
- Entities processed (companies, sources, jobs)
- Created and improved counts
- Quality scores (average across all entities)
- Health status (healthy % of entities)
- Validation errors by type
- Data issues categorized

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from tests.e2e.helpers import DataQualityMonitor, format_quality_report

# Create and start monitor
monitor = DataQualityMonitor()
monitor.start_test_run("e2e_test_12345")

# Track a company
monitor.track_company(
    company_id="mongodb_123",
    company_data={
        "name": "MongoDB",
        "website": "https://mongodb.com",
        "about": "Document database",
        "tier": "S",
        "techStack": ["Python", "Go"],
    },
    is_new=True,
)

# Track a job source
monitor.track_job_source(
    source_id="source_456",
    source_data={
        "name": "MongoDB Careers",
        "sourceType": "greenhouse",
        "config": {"board_token": "mongodb"},
        "enabled": True,
        "companyId": "mongodb_123",
    },
    is_new=True,
)

# Track job matches
monitor.track_job_match(
    job_id="job_789",
    job_data={
        "title": "Senior Engineer",
        "company": "MongoDB",
        "link": "https://boards.greenhouse.io/mongodb/jobs/1234",
        "matchScore": 94.5,
    },
    is_new=True,
)

# Generate report
report = monitor.end_test_run()
print(format_quality_report(report))
```

### In E2E Scenarios

```python
class MyScenario(BaseE2EScenario):
    def execute(self):
        # Create company
        company_id = self._create_company(...)
        company_data = self._fetch_company(company_id)
        
        # Track if monitor is available
        if hasattr(self, 'quality_monitor') and self.quality_monitor:
            metrics = self.quality_monitor.track_company(
                company_id=company_id,
                company_data=company_data,
                is_new=True,
            )
            
            if not metrics.is_healthy:
                print(f"⚠ Company has issues:")
                for error in metrics.validation_errors:
                    print(f"  - {error}")
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# With all features (log streaming + data quality)
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project"
python tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py --database portfolio-staging

# Just data quality (no logs)
python tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py --no-logs

# Specific scenarios
python tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py --scenarios CompanySourceDiscoveryScenario

# Verbose output
python tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py --verbose
```

## How It Fits Into Your E2E Testing

The data quality monitor is one part of a **complete observability system:**

1. **Log Streaming** - See what's happening in real-time
2. **Data Quality Monitoring** - Validate that results are good
3. **Queue Monitoring** - Track job pipeline execution

All three work together in `tests/e2e/run_with_streaming.py` to provide comprehensive insights.

---

## Benefits

✅ **Catches quality issues early** - Before they reach users

✅ **Validates improvements** - Fixes actually improve quality

✅ **Provides metrics** - Track progress over time

✅ **Identifies problem areas** - Which fields/types need work

✅ **Enables trend analysis** - See if scores trending up or down

✅ **Integrates seamlessly** - Works with existing E2E infrastructure

✅ **Optional** - Use with or without log streaming
