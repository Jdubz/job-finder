## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Starting with fixtures** - Created comprehensive base_config and base_tech_ranks fixtures
2. **Studying implementation first** - Reviewed actual code before writing tests
3. **Testing real behavior** - Tests match actual implementation, not assumptions
4. **Comprehensive edge cases** - Covered None values, empty strings, malformed data
5. **Clear test names** - Descriptive test method names make failures easy to diagnose

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Model mismatch** - Initial tests assumed `strikes` attribute, but it's `rejections` with severity filter
2. **Default threshold** - Needed to check constants for default strike threshold (5, not 3)
3. **Word boundaries** - HR in description doesn't trigger because it's <=3 chars
4. **Implementation details** - Had to adjust tests to match actual filtering logic

### Best Practices Applied
1. ✅ One assertion per logical check
2. ✅ Realistic test data
3. ✅ Test both happy and error paths
4. ✅ Use fixtures for reusable test data
5. ✅ Clear test structure (Given/When/Then comments)
6. ✅ Fast test execution (<2 seconds)
