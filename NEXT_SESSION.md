## Current State

### Repository
- **Branch:** `develop` (synced with `main`)
- **Latest Commit:** `4d6a717` - Merge PR #13 (company-info-fetching)
- **Coverage:** 49% (414 tests passing)
- **Clean:** No uncommitted changes

### Test Coverage Breakdown
| Module | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| filters.py | 100% | âœ… Complete |
| profile/loader.py | 100% | âœ… Complete |
| date_utils.py | 100% | âœ… Complete |
| role_preference_utils.py | 100% | âœ… Complete |
| timezone_utils.py | 100% | âœ… Complete |
| search_orchestrator.py | 66% | ðŸŸ¡ Good progress |
| ai/matcher.py | 80% | ðŸŸ¡ Good coverage |
| company_size_utils.py | 93% | ðŸŸ¡ Near complete |
| job_type_filter.py | 96% | ðŸŸ¡ Near complete |
| **Overall** | **49%** | ðŸŽ¯ Close to 50% target |

### What's Missing for 50%
Only 29 more statements needed! Quick wins:
- `company_size_utils.py` - 3 missing lines (lines 190, 192, 194)
- `job_type_filter.py` - 3 missing lines (lines 252, 334-335)
- Small additions to existing test files would push us over 50%

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

#### Option 1: Push to 50% Coverage (1 hour)
Quick addition of edge case tests to cross the 50% threshold:
1. Add 2-3 tests to `test_company_size_utils.py` for tie-breaker logic
2. Add 1-2 tests to `test_job_type_filter.py` for edge cases
3. Run coverage check to confirm 50%+
4. Commit and celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

#### Option 2: Start Alerting System (Recommended)
Begin implementation as outlined in `docs/ALERTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`:

**Week 1, Days 1-2: Core Service**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/job-alerts

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p src/job_finder/alerts
touch src/job_finder/alert_service.py
touch src/job_finder/alerts/__init__.py
touch src/job_finder/alerts/webhook_client.py
touch src/job_finder/filters/alert_filters.py
touch src/job_finder/storage/alert_state.py

# Create config
touch config/config.alerts.yaml

# Create tests
touch tests/test_alert_service.py
touch tests/test_alert_filters.py
touch tests/test_webhook_client.py
```

**Implementation Order:**
1. `StrictAlertFilter` - Enhanced pre-AI filtering
2. `JobAlertService` - Main orchestration logic
3. `AlertWebhookClient` - Webhook with retry logic
4. `AlertStateManager` - Deduplication tracking
5. Configuration and entry point

## Key Files Reference

### Documentation
- `docs/ALERTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` - Complete alerting system design
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall system architecture
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines

### Configuration
- `config/config.yaml` - Main search configuration
- `config/config.alerts.yaml` - (To create) Alert configuration
- `config/config.production.yaml` - Production settings

### Core Modules
- `src/job_finder/search_orchestrator.py` - Main search orchestration (66% coverage)
- `src/job_finder/ai/matcher.py` - AI job matching (80% coverage)
- `src/job_finder/filters.py` - Basic filtering (100% coverage)
- `src/job_finder/utils/job_type_filter.py` - Role/seniority filtering (96% coverage)

### Testing
- `tests/test_search_orchestrator.py` - 37 tests for orchestrator
- `tests/test_ai_matcher.py` - 22 tests for AI matching
- `tests/test_filters.py` - Complete filter coverage

## Environment Setup Reminder

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Firebase/Firestore
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=".firebase/static-sites-257923-firebase-adminsdk.json"
export STORAGE_DATABASE_NAME="portfolio-staging"
export PROFILE_DATABASE_NAME="portfolio"

# For Alerts (when implementing)
export WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY="<generate-secure-key>"
export PORTFOLIO_WEBHOOK_URL="https://jdubz.io/api/notifications/job-alert"
export EMAIL_USER="<your-email>"
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="<app-specific-password>"
```

### Virtual Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pytest  # Run all tests
pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=html  # Coverage report
```

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

### High Priority
- [ ] No high-priority issues currently

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Search orchestrator coverage could be improved (66% â†’ 80%)
- [ ] Some Firestore modules have low coverage (10-16%)
- [ ] RSS scraper needs more tests (14% coverage)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Company info fetcher could use more tests (14% coverage)
- [ ] Main entry point has no tests (0% coverage) - intentional

---

## Helpful Commands

```bash
# Run tests
pytest -v
pytest tests/test_search_orchestrator.py -v  # Specific file
pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=term-missing  # Coverage

# Code quality
black src/ tests/  # Format
flake8 src/ tests/  # Lint
mypy src/  # Type check

# Git workflow
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Description"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Pre-push checks
# Automatically run by hooks:
# - mypy type checking
# - full test suite
# - coverage report
```

---

## Questions to Address Next Session

1. **Alerting Priority**: Start alerting system or finish 50% coverage first?
2. **Webhook URL**: Where should we host the portfolio webhook endpoint?
3. **FCM Setup**: Need to configure Firebase Cloud Messaging in portfolio
4. **Alert Schedule**: Hourly is default, but should it be more/less frequent?
5. **Email Provider**: Gmail, SendGrid, or something else for fallback?

## Background Processes

**Note:** Two background job search processes are still running from previous session:
- Shell 6ab4a5: Running with staging database
- Shell 3be563: Running with .env configuration

**Action Required:** Kill these before starting work:
```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux | grep run_search.py

# Kill if needed
pkill -f run_search.py
```

---

## Success Metrics
