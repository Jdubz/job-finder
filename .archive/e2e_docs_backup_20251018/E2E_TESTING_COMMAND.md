# Single Makefile Command for Complete E2E Testing

## TL;DR

Run the complete E2E testing pipeline in one command:

```bash
make test-e2e-full
```

This single command:
- **Stores** existing Firestore data as backup
- **Cleans** test collections for clean testing
- **Periodically Submits** test jobs with known values  
- **Monitors** job processing with streaming logs
- **Saves Results** with comprehensive analysis and reports

## The Command

### What You Run
```bash
make test-e2e-full
```

### What It Does
1. **[1/5]** Backs up existing Firestore data
2. **[2/5]** Cleans test collections
3. **[3/5]** Runs E2E test scenarios with streaming logs
4. **[4/5]** Analyzes results and metrics
5. **[5/5]** Saves comprehensive reports

### Time to Complete
- **Quick:** 5-7 minutes for standard test suite
- **Full:** 8-10 minutes with full Google Cloud Logs streaming

### Output
Results saved to: `test_results/e2e_{timestamp}/`

## Key Metrics Tracked

The command validates these performance targets:

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Dedup Speed | < 2ms/job | Job processing efficiency |
| Rotation Fairness | > 95% | Fair source selection |
| Timeout Rate | < 5% | System stability |
| Data Quality | > 95% | Accuracy of collected data |
| Success Rate | > 98% | Overall reliability |

## Common Usage Patterns

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
# Lightweight E2E validation
make test-e2e
```

### Full Suite with Cloud Logs
```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
make test-e2e-full
```

### Scheduled Testing (Nightly)
```bash
# Add to crontab: Run every night at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/job-finder && make test-e2e-full
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: make test-e2e-full
```

### Compare Multiple Runs
```bash
# Run 1
make test-e2e-full
# Results in: test_results/e2e_TIMESTAMP1/

# Make changes...

# Run 2  
make test-e2e-full
# Results in: test_results/e2e_TIMESTAMP2/

# Compare
diff test_results/e2e_TIMESTAMP1/analysis/quality_report.json \
     test_results/e2e_TIMESTAMP2/analysis/quality_report.json
```

## Results Files

Each test run generates:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backup/jobs.json` | Backup of jobs before test |
| `backup/backup_metadata.json` | Backup timestamps and counts |
| `e2e_output.log` | Raw test execution output |
| `analysis/job_submission_analysis.json` | Job metrics |
| `analysis/collection_comparison.json` | Before/after comparison |
| `analysis/quality_report.json` | Data quality metrics |
| `final_report.json` | Consolidated results |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "make: command not found" | Run in project root: `cd /path/to/job-finder` |
| "Permission denied" | Setup venv: `make setup` |
| Tests hang | Check Firestore connectivity |
| GCP logs not working | Set: `export GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id` |
| Results not saving | Check `test_results/` directory exists and is writable |

## Integration with Development

### In Git Workflow
```bash
# Before committing changes
make test-e2e-full

# Review results
cat test_results/e2e_TIMESTAMP/analysis/quality_report.json
```

### In Feature Development
```bash
# After implementing feature
make test-e2e-full

# Compare with baseline
make test-e2e-full  # Run again after fixes
diff test_results/e2e_RUN1 test_results/e2e_RUN2
```

### In Continuous Integration
```bash
# Auto-run on pull requests
make test && make test-e2e-full && make quality
```

## All Available Testing Commands

```bash
make test                # All unit tests
